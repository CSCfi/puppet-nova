    A recent change making nova-metadata-api work with wsgi
    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/582621/ moved the vendordata plugin
    parameters to the nova::metadata manifest.
    While this is conceptually correct as nova-metadata is the one that
    should be using this parameters. In practice the parameters are also
    used in compute drivers (in the ironic driver, for instance), thats
    why we should split them to be able to deploy nova-metadata-api
    separate from nova-compute.
