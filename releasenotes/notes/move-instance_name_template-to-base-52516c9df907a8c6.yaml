    The new ``nova::instance_name_template`` parameter has been added so that
    the ``[DEFAULT] instance_name_template`` option can be configured for
    not only nova-api but also the other nova services.
    The ``nova::api::instance_name_template`` parameter is still supported but
    is no loger recomemnded because it can cause incomplete configurations in
    case nova services are deployed in different nodes.
